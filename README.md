Every second, the app makes an API call to fetch a new random decimal number. This number is converted to binary, and each digit is visualized using a traffic light:

    Red for 0

    Green for 1

    Yellow while loading (during API fetch)

Each digit in the binary number corresponds to one traffic light, updating in real time.
